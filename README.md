\- \`request.args\` → URL query parameters (GET data).

\- \`request.form\` → Data submitted through HTML forms (POST).

\- \`request.files\` → Uploaded files from client.

\- \`request.json\` → JSON payload sent in request body.

\- \`request.headers\` → Metadata of HTTP request.

\- \`request.cookies\` → Cookies sent by client browser.

\- \`request.path\` → URL path accessed.

\- \`request.full\_path\` → Full path including query string.

\- \`request.url\` → Complete request URL.

\- \`request.base\_url\` → Base URL without query parameters.

\- \`request.remote\_addr\` → Client IP address.

\- \`request.user\_agent\` → Browser/system details of client.

\- \`request.data\` → Raw request body data.

\- \`request.mimetype\` → Type of content sent (e.g., application/json).

\#### 🔹 Model Serialization & Execution Flow

\- \*\*Pickle\*\* → Used to serialize (save) trained ML models.

\- \*\*Pickling a model\*\* → Saving trained model into \`.pkl\` file.

\- \*\*Deserialization (\`rb\` mode)\*\* → Loading model back using read-binary mode.

\- \*\*\`with open()\`\*\* → Safe file handling; automatically closes file.

\- \*\*\`\_\_name\_\_\` and \`\_\_main\_\_\`\*\* → Ensures app runs only when file is executed directly.

\- \*\*Route decorators (\`@app.route\`)\*\* → Map URLs to Python functions.

\- \*\*\`render\_template()\`\*\* → Renders HTML files using Jinja2.

\`\`\`python

app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)

*   Default Flask development port → **5000**.

  Define the nature/format of a file (e.g., text/html, application/json) so browsers know how to process it.

- **Server Block (Virtual Server)**  
  Defines configuration for a specific domain/port.  
  Contains directives like `listen`, `server_name`, `location`, etc.

- **proxy_set_header**  
  Forwards client request headers (like Host) to backend application server.
