  \sigma^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 f(x) \, dx - \mu^2
  \]  
- Solved examples on above concepts.  

#### 🎲 Continuous Uniform Distribution
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}, \quad a \leq x \leq b
  \]  
- **Mean (μ):** \( \frac{a+b}{2} \)  
- **Variance (σ²):** \( \frac{(b-a)^2}{12} \)  
- **CDF:**  
  \[
  F(x) = \frac{x-a}{b-a}
  \]  

#### 🔔 Normal (Gaussian) Distribution
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
  \]  
- **Standard Normal Variable:**  
  - \( \mu = 0, \sigma^2 = 1 \).  
  - CDF denoted by \( \Phi(x) \).  
- Differentiating between **CDF** and **PDF** in real-life contexts.

### 🛑 ProgCode Lab
- **Time:** 4:30 PM onwards  
- Scheduled but **skipped** today.  
- Everyone went home early.

### 🌙 Evening Reflection
- Planned to study in the library, but felt low.  
- Roamed around college, stood in the **3rd floor gallery** (silent, almost empty).  
- Later sat in the **1st floor canteen area**, missing her deeply because there was no one to talk to.  
- On the way home at 6 PM:  
  - Ate **spicy boiled sweet corn** in the rain.  
  - Sat at the nearest bus station, thinking about her. ❤️  
- Excited to meet her this weekend for her **birthday celebration**! 🎉
