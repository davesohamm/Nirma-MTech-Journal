### 📚 Lectures

#### 🖥️ Big Data Systems (11:40 AM – 12:35 PM) – *JV Sir*
- Topic: **Hadoop Ecosystem**  
- Covered: Pig, Hive, HBase, Sqoop, Mahout, Oozie, Zookeeper, MapReduce, HDFS, etc.  
- Explained **CAP Theorem**.  
- In-depth discussion on:  
  - **HBase**: A distributed, scalable, NoSQL database that runs on top of HDFS. It provides real-time read/write access to large datasets and supports structured as well as semi-structured data.  
  - **Hive**: A data warehouse system built on Hadoop, allowing SQL-like queries (HiveQL) to analyze large datasets. It is more suitable for batch processing and reporting.  
  - **Pig**: A high-level platform for creating MapReduce programs using Pig Latin, a scripting language that simplifies complex data transformations and analysis.  

#### 🤖 Applied Machine Learning (12:35 PM – 1:30 PM) – *NKP Sir*
- Topic: **Naive Bayes Classification**  
- Covered probability basics:  
  - Conditional Probability:  
    \[
    P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A,B)}{P(B)}
    \]  
  - Independent Probability:  
    \[
    P(A|B) = P(A) \quad \text{or} \quad P(B|A) = P(B)
    \]  
- **Bayes Theorem:**  
  \[
  P(C_k|X) = \frac{P(C_k) P(X|C_k)}{P(X)}
  \]  
  where \(C_k\) are classes and \(X = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)\) are features.  
- Proved the formula mathematically.  
- For comparison (like \(P(C_1|X) / P(C_2|X)\)), \(P(X)\) can be ignored.  
- Derived **Naive Bayes Classifier Equation:**  
  \[
  P(C_k|X) \propto P(C_k) \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i|C_k)
  \]
