- Introduced the overall syllabus and real-world relevance of MLOps.
- Key topics discussed:

  - **What is MLOps:**  
    MLOps is a set of practices that combines machine learning, DevOps, and data engineering to deploy, monitor, and maintain ML models reliably in production.

  - **MLOps vs DevOps:**  
    DevOps focuses on software delivery, while MLOps extends this to handle data dependency, model versioning, retraining, and monitoring model performance.

  - **Feature Engineering:**  
    The process of transforming raw data into meaningful features that improve model performance and stability.

  - **Jenkins:**  
    A CI/CD automation tool used to automate model training, testing, and deployment pipelines.

  - **MLflow:**  
    A platform for tracking experiments, logging metrics, managing models, and handling reproducibility in ML workflows.

  - **Model Graveyard Problem:**  
    Many models are trained but never deployed or maintained, leading to unused, outdated models — referred to as the model graveyard.

  - **Data & Concept Drift:**  
    Changes in data distribution or real-world behavior that degrade model performance over time, requiring monitoring and retraining.

  - **Prometheus & Grafana:**  
    Used for monitoring system and model metrics, visualizing performance trends, and detecting anomalies.

  - **Kubernetes:**

- Key explanations:

  - **AI vs ML vs DL:**  
    AI is the broad goal of intelligent behavior, ML is learning from data, and DL is a subset of ML using deep neural networks.

  - **ML vs DL (Core Difference):**  
    ML relies heavily on manual feature engineering, while DL automatically learns hierarchical features from raw data using neural networks.

  - **GenAI & Agentic AI:**  
    GenAI focuses on generating content (text, images, code), while Agentic AI involves systems that can plan, decide, and act autonomously toward goals.

**Key Topics Discussed (LLMOps):**
- **LLMOps vs MLOps:**  
  MLOps handles classical ML models, while LLMOps deals with additional challenges like prompt management, high inference costs, latency, and safety for large-scale language models.

- **Grounding:**  
  Ensures LLM responses are based on verified, factual data rather than hallucinations, improving reliability and trustworthiness.

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):**  
  Combines LLMs with external knowledge sources to fetch relevant information before generating responses, improving accuracy and freshness.

- **Latency:**  
  Inference time is critical in LLM applications; optimizing response speed is essential for real-time user experiences.

- **Inference Optimization:**  
  Techniques like batching, quantization, and caching are used to reduce compute cost and improve throughput.

- **PFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning):**  
  Fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters to adapt large models efficiently without retraining the entire model.

- **Common Deployment Challenges:**  
  Includes scalability, cost management, monitoring hallucinations, prompt versioning, and model updates.

- **Data Drift:**  
  Changes in input data or user behavior over time can degrade model performance, requiring continuous monitoring.

- **GDPR & HIPAA Compliance:**

## **Day 139 — 19 January 2026 (Monday)**

**Reached college:** 7:45 AM  
- Came to college on **Patil’s Activa** — he gave me a lift today.

### 🎓 Lectures & Academics

**7:45 AM – 8:40 AM | Explainable AI**  
- Lecture by **NKP Sir**.
- Explained key concepts:
  - **Interpretability:** Ability to understand how a model makes decisions.
  - **Transparency:** How open and understandable the internal workings of a model are.
  - **Fairness:** Ensuring model predictions are unbiased and equitable across groups.
  - **Explainability:** Techniques used to justify and explain individual predictions.

- Discussed an important trade-off:
  - **Interpretability is inversely proportional to model complexity** — as models become more complex (e.g., ensembles, deep learning), they become harder to interpret.

- Gave an example problem:
  - Train a **Random Forest classifier** on the **Iris dataset**.
  - Apply **SHAP** to explain feature contributions.
  - Improve interpretability and transparency of predictions in a **multiclass ML model**.

**8:40 AM – 9:40 AM | Soft Computing**
- Lecture was postponed.
- Slept in the classroom due to lack of sleep the previous night.

**9:50 AM – 10:40 AM | MLOps**  
- Lecture by **Priyank Thakkar Sir**.

**MLOps Lifecycle (7 Steps):**
1. **Data Collection & Validation** – Gathering reliable, clean, and representative data.
2. **Data Preparation & Feature Engineering** – Transforming raw data into meaningful features.
3. **Model Training** – Training models with reproducibility and version control.
4. **Model Evaluation** – Validating performance using metrics and test datasets.
5. **Model Deployment** – Serving models in production environments.
6. **Monitoring** – Tracking model performance, drift, latency, and failures.
7. **Retraining & Maintenance** – Updating models based on new data and feedback.

**Virtualization vs Containerization:**
- **Virtualization (VMs):**
  - Uses a **hypervisor** to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical host.
  - Each VM has its **own OS kernel + user space**, making it heavyweight and slower.

  **Hypervisors:**
  - **Type 1 (Bare-metal):**  
    Runs directly on hardware, more efficient and secure.  
    *Examples:* VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen.
  - **Type 2 (Hosted):**  
    Runs on top of a host OS, easier to use but slower.  
    *Examples:* VirtualBox, VMware Workstation.

- **Containerization:**
  - OS-level virtualization.
  - Containers share the **host OS kernel** and only include **user space**.
  - No container has its own kernel.
  - Containers always require a **Linux kernel**; on Windows, **WSL** is needed.
  - Requires a **container runtime / engine**:
    - Docker, containerd, Podman, etc.
  - Containers are **lightweight and fast**, whereas VMs are **heavyweight and slower**.

**10:40 AM – 11:40 AM | Deep Learning**  
- Lecture by **Swati Jain Ma’am**.
- Solved examples involving:
  - Given feature space size, number of hidden neurons, and output classes.
