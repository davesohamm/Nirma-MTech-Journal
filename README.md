### 🌱 Realizations (Start of 2026)
The year began with three clear realizations:
1. I still have **a lot to learn** — I know very little.
2. I need to **dive fully into the moment** and be completely present.
3. **It takes everything you’ve got** — I borrowed a book on this exact theme from the book bank today.

### 🕉️ Personal
- After reaching home, we had **Satyanarayan Katha**, which restored some faith, calmness, and motivation within me.

**Closing Thought:**  
*Let’s see where 2026 takes me.*

## **Day 136 — 12 January 2025 (Monday)**

**First Day of Semester 2**  
**Reached college:** 7:45 AM

### 🎓 Lectures & Academics

**7:45 AM – 8:40 AM | Explainable AI**  
- Lecture by **NKP Sir**.
- As it was the first day of the semester, he primarily explained:
  - Course syllabus
  - Evaluation structure
  - Importance of interpretability and transparency in AI systems

**8:40 AM – 9:40 AM | Free Period**
- Solved **1 LeetCode problem**:
  - [Minimum Time Visiting All Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-visiting-all-points/description/)

**9:40 AM – 10:35 AM | MLOps**  
- Lecture by **Priyank Thakkar Sir**.
- Introduced the overall syllabus and real-world relevance of MLOps.
- Key topics discussed:

  - **What is MLOps:**  
    MLOps is a set of practices that combines machine learning, DevOps, and data engineering to deploy, monitor, and maintain ML models reliably in production.

  - **MLOps vs DevOps:**  
    DevOps focuses on software delivery, while MLOps extends this to handle data dependency, model versioning, retraining, and monitoring model performance.

  - **Feature Engineering:**  
    The process of transforming raw data into meaningful features that improve model performance and stability.

  - **Jenkins:**  
    A CI/CD automation tool used to automate model training, testing, and deployment pipelines.

  - **MLflow:**  
    A platform for tracking experiments, logging metrics, managing models, and handling reproducibility in ML workflows.

  - **Model Graveyard Problem:**  
    Many models are trained but never deployed or maintained, leading to unused, outdated models — referred to as the model graveyard.

  - **Data & Concept Drift:**  
    Changes in data distribution or real-world behavior that degrade model performance over time, requiring monitoring and retraining.

  - **Prometheus & Grafana:**  
    Used for monitoring system and model metrics, visualizing performance trends, and detecting anomalies.

  - **Kubernetes:**  
    An orchestration platform used to deploy, scale, and manage containerized ML services efficiently.

**10:35 AM – 11:40 AM | Deep Learning**  
- Lecture by **Swati Jain Ma’am**.
- Explained the syllabus and foundational concepts.
- Key explanations:

  - **AI vs ML vs DL:**  
    AI is the broad goal of intelligent behavior, ML is learning from data, and DL is a subset of ML using deep neural networks.

  - **ML vs DL (Core Difference):**  
    ML relies heavily on manual feature engineering, while DL automatically learns hierarchical features from raw data using neural networks.

  - **GenAI & Agentic AI:**  
    GenAI focuses on generating content (text, images, code), while Agentic AI involves systems that can plan, decide, and act autonomously toward goals.

### ☕ Break
**11:40 AM – 12:35 PM**
