- Slept for some time in the library. 

### 🌱 Realizations (Start of 2026)
The year began with three clear realizations:
1. I still have **a lot to learn** — I know very little.
2. I need to **dive fully into the moment** and be completely present.
3. **It takes everything you’ve got** — I borrowed a book on this exact theme from the book bank today.

### 🕉️ Personal
- After reaching home, we had **Satyanarayan Katha**, which restored some faith, calmness, and motivation within me.

**Closing Thought:**  
*Let’s see where 2026 takes me.*
