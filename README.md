## **Day 150 — 4 February 2026 (Wednesday)**

\*\*Reached college:\*\* 7:45 AM

\### 🎓 Lectures & Academics

\*\*7:45 AM – 9:40 AM | Explainable AI Lab\*\*

\- Lab by \*\*NKP Sir\*\*.

\- Sir evaluated the \*\*first 2 practicals\*\* (marks not shown yet — hoping I scored well).

\- During lab time, I also solved \*\*1 LeetCode problem\*\*.

\*\*9:50 AM – 10:35 AM | MLOps\*\*

\- Lecture by \*\*Dr. Priyank Thakkar Sir\*\*.

\- Complete backend walkthrough of \*\*\`app.py\` (Flask Application)\*\*.

\#### 🔹 Flask & Backend Concepts

\- \*\*Flask\*\* → Lightweight Python web framework for building backend applications.

\- \*\*Jinja2\*\* → Template engine used to dynamically render HTML pages.

\#### 🔹 \`request\` Object in Flask

\- \`request.method\` → HTTP method used (GET, POST, etc.).

\- \`request.args\` → URL query parameters (GET data).

\- \`request.form\` → Data submitted through HTML forms (POST).

\- \`request.files\` → Uploaded files from client.

\- \`request.json\` → JSON payload sent in request body.

\- \`request.headers\` → Metadata of HTTP request.

\- \`request.cookies\` → Cookies sent by client browser.

\- \`request.path\` → URL path accessed.

\- \`request.full\_path\` → Full path including query string.

\- \`request.url\` → Complete request URL.

\- \`request.base\_url\` → Base URL without query parameters.

\- \`request.remote\_addr\` → Client IP address.

\- \`request.user\_agent\` → Browser/system details of client.

\- \`request.data\` → Raw request body data.

\- \`request.mimetype\` → Type of content sent (e.g., application/json).

\#### 🔹 Model Serialization & Execution Flow

\- \*\*Pickle\*\* → Used to serialize (save) trained ML models.

\- \*\*Pickling a model\*\* → Saving trained model into \`.pkl\` file.

\- \*\*Deserialization (\`rb\` mode)\*\* → Loading model back using read-binary mode.

\- \*\*\`with open()\`\*\* → Safe file handling; automatically closes file.

\- \*\*\`\_\_name\_\_\` and \`\_\_main\_\_\`\*\* → Ensures app runs only when file is executed directly.

\- \*\*Route decorators (\`@app.route\`)\*\* → Map URLs to Python functions.

\- \*\*\`render\_template()\`\*\* → Renders HTML files using Jinja2.

\`\`\`python

app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)

*   Default Flask development port → **5000**.
    
*   host="0.0.0.0" → Makes the app accessible to all devices in the same network.
    

**10:40 AM – 11:45 AM | Soft Computing**

*   Lecture by **Rajesh Gupta Sir**.
    
*   Topics covered:
    
    *   **2D Membership Function Visualization**.
        
    *   **Fuzzy Propositions**:
        
        *   Negation
            
        *   AND
            
        *   OR
            
        *   Implication
            
        *   Equality
            
    *   All explained with formulas and truth table examples.
        
    *   Key difference:
        
        *   Crisp logic → Only True or False.
            
        *   Fuzzy logic → Multi-valued (between 0 and 1).
