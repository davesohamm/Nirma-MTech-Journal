### 🎓 Lectures & Academics

**7:45 AM – 8:40 AM | Explainable AI**  
- Lecture by **NKP Sir**.
- Explained key concepts:
  - **Interpretability:** Ability to understand how a model makes decisions.
  - **Transparency:** How open and understandable the internal workings of a model are.
  - **Fairness:** Ensuring model predictions are unbiased and equitable across groups.
  - **Explainability:** Techniques used to justify and explain individual predictions.

- Discussed an important trade-off:
  - **Interpretability is inversely proportional to model complexity** — as models become more complex (e.g., ensembles, deep learning), they become harder to interpret.

- Gave an example problem:
  - Train a **Random Forest classifier** on the **Iris dataset**.
  - Apply **SHAP** to explain feature contributions.
  - Improve interpretability and transparency of predictions in a **multiclass ML model**.

**8:40 AM – 9:40 AM | Soft Computing**

2. **Data Preparation & Feature Engineering** – Transforming raw data into meaningful features.
3. **Model Training** – Training models with reproducibility and version control.
4. **Model Evaluation** – Validating performance using metrics and test datasets.
5. **Model Deployment** – Serving models in production environments.
6. **Monitoring** – Tracking model performance, drift, latency, and failures.
7. **Retraining & Maintenance** – Updating models based on new data and feedback.

**Virtualization vs Containerization:**
- **Virtualization (VMs):**
  - Uses a **hypervisor** to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical host.
  - Each VM has its **own OS kernel + user space**, making it heavyweight and slower.

  **Hypervisors:**
  - **Type 1 (Bare-metal):**  
    Runs directly on hardware, more efficient and secure.  
    *Examples:* VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen.
  - **Type 2 (Hosted):**  
    Runs on top of a host OS, easier to use but slower.  
    *Examples:* VirtualBox, VMware Workstation.

- **Containerization:**
  - OS-level virtualization.
  - Containers share the **host OS kernel** and only include **user space**.
  - No container has its own kernel.
  - Containers always require a **Linux kernel**; on Windows, **WSL** is needed.
  - Requires a **container runtime / engine**:
    - Docker, containerd, Podman, etc.
  - Containers are **lightweight and fast**, whereas VMs are **heavyweight and slower**.

**10:40 AM – 11:40 AM | Deep Learning**
